## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose
I previously made code that focused on information for candidates that went into detail about their votes and who won the election. Now the committee would like more information that can help give a bigger picture of the election results. I want to produce data for the county voter turnout, percentage of county votes, and the highest turnout for each county. 

## Analysis

### Election Audit Results

- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

- Which county had the largest number of votes?

- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
